apt-get install msp430-libc binutils-msp430 gcc-msp430 msp430mcu gdb-msp430

---> common
# Yes, git needs to be installed. sudo apt-get install git.
git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/mspdebug/code mspdebug
# Lets just assume that GNU readline will be useful to you someday.
apt-get install libusb-dev libreadline-dev
cd mspdebug
make
# It will install to /usr/local/bin with includes and man pages.
make install

This part worked as far but the connection to the FET device were unsuccessful. (next I followed the msp430.dll v3)

---> for msp430.dll v2
# If you don't want to use sudo, add yourself to the dialout group.
# For whatever strange reason, mspdebug tilib -j -d /dev/ttyACM0 didn't work for me.
mspdebug tilib

---> for msp430.dll v3
# This compressed folder contains the MSP_DebugStack_OS_Package.
wget http://www-s.ti.com/sc/techzip/slac460.zip

(this did not work, I downloaded from the web and used version n: slac460n.zip)

-> go into MSP_DebugStack_OS_Package and read the README-BUILD.txt, section for Linux.
From it you will learn that you additionally libboost and hidapi. 
 
# libboost is easy, just type:
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-date-time-dev
 
# hidapi 
# check section 2.2, download archive of release from https://github.com/signal11/hidapi/releases
# go into main project directory and read README.txt, section "Building HIDAPI into a shared library on Unix Platforms"
# hid-libusb.o does not exist under this name, rename/use ./linux/hid.o

# now you can build the mspdebug
# check the description under http://dlbeer.co.nz/mspdebug/tilib.html
